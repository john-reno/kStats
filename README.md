# kStats

An app for Fitbit smartwatches which allows you to view your Kiezelpay sales data via your API key. It's a heavily modified version of the [K·pay merchant API module](https://github.com/KiezelPay/fitbit_kpay_merchant_api)

## What does each stat mean?

## How does it work?

👉 Add your kPay API key in the settings page. Find your API key here: https://kiezelpay.com/account/api

👉 If it doesn't update after adding the API key, you may need to restart the app.

ℹ️ kStats will refresh every 5 minutes. If vibrations are turned on, you will feel specific vibrations depending on how much you've made since the last refresh.

ℹ️ kStats will show how much you've made since you last opened the app. This will only work after a previous value is saved, and if you reopen the app on the same day.
